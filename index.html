        <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Students will explore the world of inpatient ICU care by examining severe infection management and detection using the MIMIC dataset, a comprehensive, publicly available database of de-identified ICU patient data. This project will familiarize participants with healthcare data nuances and the critical role EHRs play in clinical decision-making. Through this experience, students will gain insights into the broader context of clinical decision-making and public health, learning to leverage EHRs and clinical data science for developing potential products, reports, and or health policies. They will better understand the US healthcare system, ICU operations, and the decision-making process for complex infectious cases like sepsis. By studying the work of multidisciplinary teams, students will gain a deeper understanding of intricate ICU cases and the patients' journeys through this challenging healthcare landscape. Additionally, they will appreciate the complexities of conducting data science in a demanding environment.</p>

        <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
          <p>The aim of reproducing a paper's results is to affirm the original authors' findings and methodologies. This process is vital in science to ensure results are robust and reliable, not merely due to chance or error. Reproduction would reinforce the evidence for the identified critical care patient subgroups and their risks, potentially impacting patient care. It also provides a deeper understanding of the applied methods like latent class analysis and k-means clustering. Ultimately, this endeavor seeks to enrich critical care knowledge and potentially influence future research and clinical practice.</p>

        <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Gaining access to MIMIC data via PhysioNet can be a somewhat complex process. It's advisable to initiate this process a few weeks before your classes start, as it can take up to a month to complete verification. The process includes account creation, submitting online forms, and a two-hour online training course. Please adhere to the following steps meticulously for a smooth experience.</p>

        <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
          <p>The MIMIC dataset, a critical care database, embodies the intersection of medical research and ethical considerations. It provides a wealth of de-identified patient data, enabling researchers to study critical care conditions while respecting patient privacy. However, the use of this dataset still requires careful ethical considerations.</p>
          <p>The principle of autonomy is upheld in the MIMIC dataset as it consists of de-identified patient data, ensuring patient consent and privacy. However, researchers must remain vigilant to avoid any potential re-identification of individuals, which could infringe on patient privacy. The principle of beneficence is reflected in the use of the MIMIC dataset for research aimed at improving critical care outcomes. However, researchers must ensure that their studies are designed to maximize potential benefits, such as enhancing understanding of critical care conditions or developing new treatment strategies.</p>
          <p>Reproducibility is a key aspect of research using the MIMIC dataset. It promotes transparency and trust in the findings derived from the dataset. However, reproducing research must be balanced with maintaining data security. Researchers must ensure that they use secure methods to access and analyze the MIMIC dataset, protecting the data from unauthorized access or misuse. Remember, while the MIMIC dataset provides a valuable resource for critical care research, it also underscores the importance of ethical considerations in medical research. Researchers must navigate these ethical considerations carefully to ensure they respect patient rights and interests while advancing critical care research.</p>

          <ul role="list" class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
            <li class="py-4 italic">
              <p>Hey all! Congrats on making it to DSC 180AB. This capstone will have a steep learning curve but it will be very rewarding to both you and potential stakeholders who may be watching your project. I have 3 main pieces of advice:</p>
              <p>1. Ask questions! - This project has a very steep learning curve with lots of terminology that most will probably not understanding walking into it. Don’t let that discourage you as everyone goes through that learning curve and instead use it as an opportunity to learn how to adapt and onboard new projects. Act like you’ve just joined a new company and Kyle is your manager. You should be asking many questions so you don’t walk into meeting completely blind. Again, it’s one of the most important skills in any field is to learn how to learn, and part of that involves asking questions! </p>
              <p>Focus on impact or why you are doing this. - In most data science classes we typically just assign you a project and you do it to complete it and earn a grade. This capstone however is not the case. You’re working with real data that other professional researchers are currently working with. So when your choosing a project path during WI quarter, think of a project that will have impact to the community (sometimes that means focus on saving money/cutting cost, saving lives, or making processes easier/faster). </p>
              <p>Think creatively and have fun! - Remember this is your senior project and you only have 2 quarters. While it may seem like a long time, it will fly by. There are many researchers still researching sepsis (including at ucsd) so get creative with your project. What are things people have already done? What are things that would better other people’s research/projects? I personally know two different research groups at ucsd focusing on sepsis detection and their addition to current research is looking at continuous vital signs rather than hourly, creating llms to read doctors notes, using imaging data, and more. So use Kyle’s connections to learn about sepsis but focus on what their processes lack or could use more of. Remember most of the people you will talk to will be doctors and nurses so how can you bridge that gap between their skills and experience as doctors with your skills as a data scientist. 
                Most of all have fun and learn! Kyle is a great mentor so do take his advice into considerations! Goodluck and I’m sure you all will enjoy it and be completely fine :)</p>
